Site Specific Configuration

Each system is inherently different, and this directory contains the extensions
to the subsystems that define the specific site the system is to be deployed.

The HAL will require a configuration defining the devices, and their
communication protocols.  The Executive will require the business logic to be
defined.  The UI will require its theme and controls to be defined.
