Executive

The Executive is a service which provides the ability to run operations on the
programmed system.  These operations are defined by the business logic created
for the specific site.  The Executive is a generic service, which uses
extensions provided by the site-specific extensions, defined elsewhere.

The Executive has two-way communication with the HAL; the executive may invoke
operations on the HAL, and the HAL may inform the executive about changes in
the hardware, and the hardware's state.
