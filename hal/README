HAL

The HAL is the hardware abstraction layer, and provides a generic way of
controlling distributed hardware devices.  The HAL provides a service which
may be queried for devices, and information about devices.  Operations may
then be performed on those devices, as defined by device classes and the
interfaces those classes expose.
