UI

The UI is what is presented to an operator of the system.  The UI may take the
form of any HCI interface, provided by web-servers, native clients, etc.

The UI communicates only with the Executive, to invoke operations on the system
logic.  The Executive may communicate with the UI to advise of changes in the
system state.
